# Google Books Search

A React-based Google Books app that searches and displays books.

## Pseudo Code
1. Create React app
2. Create models, routes, controllers, components, pages
3. Create link to API
4. Build and deploy app

Based on this my code would have to:
- Have a search feature that uses the Google Books API to retrieve data
- This data then displays on the page
- The user can save and delete this data

## Difficulties
I had some issues with my package json files so had to restart the app. However I had my files saved so I didn't have to redo them. I think I'm still a bit unfamiliar with the directory for MERN apps so I need to study this more.

## Overall thoughts
This was a difficult assignment but it was good practice on creating React apps.
